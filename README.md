# Feels
Feels is a Skill for Alexa. Tell your Echo how you feel about things/places/people/ideas and recall those feelings at a later and apathetic date.

Are you sure about how you feel about something and are afraid you'll forget later? Do you go through upswings and downswings of apathy? Let this app be a rock in the sea of your emotional fragility. Do you ever just want somebody to listen? Why not something?
